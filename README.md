# xpdl-to-cpn

This project is not mine, it is actually [Karl Blum](https://github.com/karlblum/xpdl-to-cpn), part of his Master's thesis. In one my projects we needed to use XPDL files and I ran into this project (it was in Google Code back then) which already had the document mappings from XML to Java classes, which was very handy. Once we started using I forked since that project depended so much on it. Actually, I have found out that he did the github migration, which can be found [here](https://github.com/karlblum/xpdl-to-cpn), so I might delete this repository in the future.
